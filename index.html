                        <p>
                            Everyone wants to learn programming usually starting with any programming language, Although we have a lot of programming languages they all have the same fundamentals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this technical documentation, I took about the fundamentals that you will learn with any language you will choose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fundamentals that we talk about:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Variables</li>

                        <p>
                            In this document, our examples will be with <strong>JavaScript language</strong>.

                            Any programming you will build in your career will have data, and it will be hard to treat with data without anything that can maintain this data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So that we use variables, with variables I can maintain my program's data and treat with users data also.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Example:
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <code>
                                let x = 1;
                                
                                let y = 5;
                                
                                let z = y + x;
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>In the last example, you can see the word <strong>let</strong> this word we used with <em>JavaScript language</em> to tell that we well make variable.</p>
                        <p>All of <strong>(x, y, z) is our variable.</strong></p>
                        
                        <div>
                            <code>
                                let x = 1; <span>// variable x contain the value 1.</span>
                                
                                let y = 5; <span>// variable y contain the value 5.</span>
                                
                                let z = y + x; <spna>// variable z contain the result of x + z = 1 + 5 = 6.</spna>
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        
                    </article>
                    
                </section>

                <section id = "print_functions" class="main-section">
                     <!-- header of the section -->
                     <header>
                        <h2>Print functions</h2>

                        <p>
                            When a programmer work on his project, he all the time needs to see the result of his code, to be sure if he is in the right way or not.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So in any programming language, you will have a print function that can print the result of your code, usually, we didn't use it to print anything to our users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>JavaScript</em> print functions:
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <code>
                                let x = "Ahmed Love FreeCodeCamp";
                                
                                console.log(x);
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            In our code above you maybe know this part: <strong>let x = "..."</strong>,It's our variable, but this part <strong>(console.log(x))</strong> is out print function.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My console will output this value:
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <code>
                                Ahmed Love FreeCodeCamp
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Of course, the <strong>console.log()</strong> function is not the only printing function in <em>JavaScript</em>, and any language usually has multiple of them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In large projects you will have many program sentences and other programmers working with you in the same project, Usually, the programmers needed something to tell them what is your code do without reading your code to avoid wasting time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So that every language has a way to write a comment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The common stile to write a comment in one line in several programming languages:
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <code>
                                <span>// your comment</span>
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The style above we used also in <em>JavaScript</em>, and this is a common style to write a comment:
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <code>
                                <span>
                                    /*
                                        your comment
                                        your comment
                                        your comment
                                    */
                                <span></span>
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            You don't use comments to explain your code for other programmers only, you use them for you also to organize your code.

                            In the variables lesson, we maintain in variable x a number, and in the Print functions lesson, we maintain in it a text value.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The values that we add to our programs variables have several types, and every type has a special way that the language treats it.

                       <p>
                        When you built your program you may need to customize your code for several cases, in this situation we used the <strong>if statement</strong>
                       </p>
                       <p>
                             Say that I have a move for adults only or children with their patents, and I didn't want only children to see the movie.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        To solve the problem we will use the <strong>if statement</strong> because we have many cases.

                           You can use <strong>if statement</strong> to treat with infinite cases.

                            In many situations you will repeat your code with a type of progress many times, I can say that is what we do most of our coding time. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So that we have the loop concept, Every programing language has it's own loop statement. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The common keyword for <strong>loop concept</strong> is <strong>for</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The code below is a loop for printing numbers from 1 to 10 in <em>JavaScript</em>. 
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <code>
                                for( let i = 1 ; i &lt;= 10; i++ )
                                {
                                    console.log(i);
                                }

                       <p>
                        You learned some great concepts in programming until now, but when you learn them in a new language, you will be confused when you try to build an extra small project.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                            This will be because you will have many variables and statements and it will make you confused. So that we have a function.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The function is a concept that can help you to split your code into parts, and you can reuse these parts again if you want.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                            The function has many benefits, and the bellow code is a function with <em>JavaScript</em>:
                       </p>
                       <div>
                            <code>
                                function printMyName10()
                                {
                                        for(let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
                                        {
                                            console.log("Ahmed Mohamed Al3adl");
                                        }
                                }
                            </code>
